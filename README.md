# üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Portfolio-Template API
#### Howdy and welcome to my Capstone! The problem space I chose to tackle is the lack of minimalistic, graphically appealing, and responsive porfolio templates on web hosting services. This project will be populated with the content for the famous director Edgar Wright, most notably known for directing the movie "Baby Driver" and "Shaun of the Dead". This template utilizes both a Front and Backend that will be required to run this project.
